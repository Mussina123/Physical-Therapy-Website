# Physical-Therapy-Website

I created a website for a Physical Therapy Company: Healing Physical Therapy, to attract the user to become a patient, due to the attractive nature of the colors, pictures, and website layout! 

**Link to project:** https://healing-physical-therapy.netlify.app/

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap 

This website was made with HTML for the layouts of each page, CSS & Bootsrap for styling, Javascript and jQuery for the sliders, animations, and for the DOM manipulation. 

## Optimizations

I created this project with basic static functionality. There is **SO MUCH** optimization that could be done for this website. 

Future optimizations include: 

- A book appointment button to sync to the companies system to allow for the patient to schedule appointment. 
- A blog page to include updated information about the clinic, new and exciting treatment options!
- Adding a payment option so the patient can easliy and quickly pay their charges online. 

## Lessons Learned:

There are so many ways you can expand and update a basic website!

There are so many useful extensions that can be used to enhance and customize your website!
